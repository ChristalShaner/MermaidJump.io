# MermaidJump.io

One of my favorite flawed projects. This is a parody of my favorite app of all time, Doodle Jump. 
This variation involves a little red mermaid hopping from rock to rock below the waves. Makes sense to me!
I programmed this with JavaScript. I enjoy experimenting with physics and graphical interfaces from time to time. Feel free to try it out through GitHub Pages. I warn you, it is a challenging game!
