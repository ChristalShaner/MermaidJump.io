# MermaidJump.io

One of my favorite flawed projects. This is a parody of my favorite app of all time, Doodle Jump. 
This variation involves a little red mermaid hopping from rock to rock below the waves. Makes sense to me!
I programmed this with JavaScript. I enjoy experimenting with physics and graphical interfaces from time to time. Feel free to try it out through GitHub Pages. All you need to do is use the right and left arrow keys, or the 'A' and 'D' keys to move the mermaid along the rocks. I warn you, it is a challenging game!
